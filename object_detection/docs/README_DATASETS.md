# <a>Object detection STM32 model zoo</a>

Before you start using this project, it's important to understand the supported dataset names and formats. Please note that for all the training, evaluation and quantization services, it is expected to have a dataset in TFS Tensorflow format. For the object detection use case, the `get_dataloaders` API call takes care of the conversion of your dataset automatically depending on the `dataset_name` and `format` attributes.

The `dataset` section and its attributes are shown in the YAML example code below.

```yaml
dataset:
  format: pascal_voc
  dataset_name: pascal_voc                                    # Dataset name. Defaults to "<unnamed>".
  class_names: [ aeroplane,bicycle,bird,boat,bottle,bus,car,cat,chair,cow,diningtable,dog,horse,motorbike,person,pottedplant,sheep,sofa,train,tvmonitor ]  # Names of the classes in the dataset.
  data_dir: <tmp-directory-where-dataset-will-be-downloaded> # Path to the tmp directory before the split.
  train_images_path: <JPEGImages-root-directory>             # Path to the root directory of the img before split.
  train_annotations_path: <path-to-the-Annotations-dir>      # Path to the root directory of the xml annotations
  val_images_path: <JPEGImages-root-directory>               # Path to the root directory of the img (usually the same as train_images_path).
  val_annotations_path: <path-to-the-Annotations-dir>        # Path to the root directory of the xml annotations (usually the same as train_annotations_path)
  test_images_path: <JPEGImages-root-directory>              # Path to the root directory of the img (usually the same as train_images_path).
  test_annotations_path: <path-to-the-Annotations-dir>       # Path to the root directory of the xml annotations (usually the same as train_annotations_path)
  train_split:  <path-to-the-ImageSets/Main/train.txt>       # Path to the .txt file containing the split for training.
  val_split:  <path-to-the-ImageSets/Main/val.txt>           # Path to the .txt file containing the split for training. (Optional)
  test_split:  <path-to-the-ImageSets/Main/test.txt>         # Path to the .txt file containing the split for training. (Optional)
  # validation_split: 0.2                                    # Training/validation sets split ratio. (Optional if val_*_path is defined)
  quantization_path: <quantization-set-root-directory>       # Path to the root directory of the quantization set.
  quantization_split:                                        # Quantization split ratio.
  seed: 123                                                  # Random generator seed used when splitting a dataset.
```

The `dataset_name` attribute is required and serves to specify the dataset you are using. This can be a well-known dataset like coco, pascal_voc, or a custom_dataset if you have your own data and it follows the logic below:

| Dataset Name     | Allowed Formats          | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `coco`           | `coco`, `tfs`           | Native COCO format or TFS TensorFlow format                                                     |
| `pascal_voc`     | `pascal_voc`, `tfs`     | Native Pascal VOC format or TFS TensorFlow format                                               |
| `darknet_yolo`   | `darknet_yolo`, `tfs`   | Native Darknet YOLO format or TFS TensorFlow format                                             |
| `custom_dataset` | `tfs`                   | Only TFS TensorFlow format; in case the dataset is already converted before evaluation                          |

Depending on the `dataset_name`, the dataset loader will check the `format` to determine if it is necessary to convert the dataset to the final **TFS TensorFlow format**. These two parameters are mandatory if the operation mode is **training**, **evaluation** and **quantization**.

The `format` attributes defines the annotation format of your dataset. This must match the format of your dataset annotations. 
It serves to check whether your dataset is in its original format or in TFS TensorFlow format. 
This determines whether it is needed to convert the dataset to the required TFS format or not. It accepts the following values: 

  * `tfs`: If the dataset is a TensorFlow Object Detection API format.
  * `coco`: If the dataset is in COCO dataset format (JSON annotations).
  * `pascal_voc`: If the dataset is in Pascal VOC XML annotation format.
  * `darknet_yolo`: If the dataset is in YOLO Darknet text file annotations.

Depending on the `format` value, some additional attributes should be defined in the dataset section:
- If the `format` is set to **coco**, the following attributes should be set:
  * The `data_dir`: Required if `download_data` is set to True, refers to the temporary path where the dataset will be downloaded.
  * The `train_images_path`: Required, refers to the path of the training subset directory where the images are located.
  * The `train_annotations_path`: Required, refers to the path of the training subset JSON file of the annotations.
  * The `val_images_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the validation subset directory where the images are located.
  * The `val_annotations_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the validation subset JSON file of the annotations.
  * The `test_images_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the test subset (evaluation-only) directory where the images are located.
  * The `test_annotations_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the test subset (evalutation-only) JSON file of the annotations.
  * The `validation_split`: Optional, refers to a % ratio of the training set, should be defined if the `val_images_path` and `val_annotations_path` are missing.

- If the `format` is set to **pascal_voc**, the following attributes should be set:
  * The `data_dir`: Required if `download_data` is set to True, refers to the temporary path where the dataset will be downloaded.
  * The `train_images_path`: Required, refers to the path of the training subset directory where the images are located.
  * The `train_annotations_path`: Required, refers to the path of the training subset directory containing the xml files of the annotations.
  * The `train_split`: Required, refers to the train.txt containing the split IDs for training subsets.
  * The `val_images_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the validation subset directory where the images are located.
  * The `val_annotations_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the training subset directory containing the XML files of the annotations.
  * The `val_split`: Required, refers to the val.txt containing the split IDs for validation subsets.
  * The `test_images_path`: Optional, refers to the path of the validation subset directory where the images are located.
